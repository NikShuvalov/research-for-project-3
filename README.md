> ***Note:*** _This homework must be done with your project 3 team_

## Exercise

Now that you've learned how to conduct user research and competitor research, it's time to use those skills to begin planning your app for Project 3. You will work with your team to form a plan for conducting user research, then over the weekend you'll interview potential users. You'll also perform a competitive analysis of existing apps that may solve some of the same user problems your app will address.

#### Requirements

- Carefully read through the requirements for the version of Project 3 assigned to your team
- Write a **user reasearch plan** based on the [Research Plan Template](assets/research-plan-worksheet.pdf)
- Conduct user interviews
  - This can include GA students from other immersives (if you want to start doing interviews today)
  - This can include friends/family/roommates (if you want to do interviews over the weekend)
  - This CANNOT include your classmates from this cohort
  - At least 6 interviews total for the team; at least 2 per person
- Identify existing apps that may compete with your app
- Perform a competitive analysis - either a **Feature Inventory** or a **Pluses & Deltas Model**, you don't need to do both - that describes and analyzes each competitor

#### Deliverable

The following deliverables are due before class on Monday, November 21:
- Your written research plan (use the [provided template](assets/research-plan-worksheet.pdf))
- Notes from each user interview (include interviewer name and date the interview was conducted)
- Your competitive analysis (either feature inventory or pluses/deltas)

One team member should make a fork of this homework repo and submit the materials for the whole team via pull request. In week 10, when you hand in the finished project, you will copy these materials into your project repo as well. If you create your documents as Google Docs, you can put links to them in your repo. Otherwise, put the documents themselves in the repo.
